## 📖 About the Project

This project started as an experiment but evolved into a full-fledged app to make confessing feelings easier and **more fun**! 🎉

I followed **Web Design Mastery’s tutorial** ([YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKx50WdhTlM&t=24s)), but I realized it was too technical for non-CS users. So, I spent time **simplifying the process** and making it **accessible** for everyone! 🚀

I followed Web Design Mastery's tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKx50WdhTlM&t=24s for the basic website. but I felt that It was almost impossible for a person from non CS background to download the code, edit it without messing it up, create account on and deloy it on netlify or any other platform. So I spent my making it accessible to all non-CS background peers. One major upgrade to this website is get email notfication after your crush yes/no on the website.

One major **upgrade**? **Email notifications** when your crush responds! 🥳
