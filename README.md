## 📖 About the Project

This project began as an experimental idea, but it quickly grew into a fully realized app aimed at making confessing feelings easier and more fun for everyone! 🎉 I initially followed tutorial by [Web Design Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@webdesignmastery23) to create the basic structure of the website. However, as I worked through it, I realized that the process was too technical for someone without a computer science background to fully understand. The steps involved—such as downloading the code, making modifications without causing errors, setting up accounts on platforms like Netlify, and deploying the site—were complicated and could easily overwhelm non-technical users.

This insight led me to focus on simplifying the process and making the website accessible to a broader audience. I spent time refining the workflow, creating an easy-to-use interface, and ensuring that even users with no technical experience could use the website without needing to worry about the underlying code or deployment steps.

One of the most significant upgrades to this website was the addition of email notifications. Previously, users would have to manually check for a response from their crush, but now, when your crush responds with a "Yes" or "No," you'll receive an instant email notification, making the whole experience much more interactive and user-friendly. 🥳
